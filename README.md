# 🛡️ Linux System Hardening & Vulnerability Mitigation Lab

This project focused on securing Ubuntu Linux servers by applying CIS benchmarks and mitigating vulnerabilities through hands-on lab exercises.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Reduced attack surface and strengthened system defenses by applying best practices such as SSH hardening, firewall configuration, and audit logging.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques Used

- Ubuntu Server 20.04  
- CIS Security Benchmarks  
- SSH Configuration  
- Firewall (UFW)  
- Auditd Logging  
- Vulnerability Simulation (Brute-force, Privilege Escalation)

---

## 🧩 Key Activities

- Performed system audits and applied CIS benchmarks to enforce security policies.  
- Simulated attack scenarios to identify vulnerabilities and validate remediation.  
- Hardened SSH to disallow root login and enforce key-based authentication.  
- Configured firewall rules to limit open ports.  
- Set up audit logging for critical system events.
